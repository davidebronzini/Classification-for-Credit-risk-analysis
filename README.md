# Classification-for-Credit-risk-analysis
In this project different machine learning models are implemented for a classification problem on credit risk analysis (3 classes) and their perfomances are compared.

## The models used are:
logistic regression with ridge regularization, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, naive bayes, k-nearest-neighbors, tree with pruning, bagging, random forest.

## R library used:
library(ISLR2)
library(dplyr)
library(nnet)
library(glmnet)
library(readxl)
library(caret)
library(klaR)
library(tree)
library(randomForest)

## dataset
Different balance sheet items of banks: Company ID	Score	Total_assets	Curr_assets	Shareh_funds	Curr_liab	Turnover	EBIT	Net_income	EBITDA	Year
